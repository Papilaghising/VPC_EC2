Terraform Module : Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module consists of a collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files kept together in a directory.

Types of Terraform modules

Modules are used to create reusable components inside your infrastructure. There are primarily two types of modules depending on how they are written (root and child modules), and depending if they are published or not, we identify two different types as well (local and published).

Root module : The root module consists of all the resources defined in the .tf files in a Terraform configuration, meaning that all Terraform configurations have their own root module. Even if you are simply creating a main.tf that has just a locals block inside of it with a local variable, that is still considered a root module. This can be confusing, but keep in mind that every Terraform configuration can become a reusable module for other configurations. Every module can call other modules, and all of the modules called inside another module are considered child modules.

Child module: Calling a child module means to include all the resources defined in that module in the current configuration. This is done by using a module block inside your Terraform configuration:



module "webservers" {
   source = "../webservers"
}
You can call the same module as many times as you want and configure it to your liking.

Local module : A local module is a module that wasnâ€™t published in any registry and when it is sourced, it is using the path to that particular module.

Published module : A published module refers to a module that has been pushed to a Terraform Registry, or even simply on a VCS and has a tag associated with it. When a published module is sourced, the URL of that module is used either from the registry or from the VCS itself.

 

Meta arguments : meta-arguments are special arguments used to modify the behavior of resources or blocks. They provide additional functionality beyond the standard resource configuration.

Allows to customize resource behavior, define dependencies between resources, control resource lifecycle, and associate providers with resources or blocks.

count
The count meta-argument in Terraform is used to create multiple instances of a resource based on a single resource configuration block. It's helpful when you want to create multiple similar resources with slight variations, such as multiple EC2 instances or multiple security groups.

for_each
The for_each meta-argument in Terraform is similar to count, but it allows you to create multiple instances of a resource based on a map or set of strings, rather than a single numerical value. This is useful when you want to create resources with unique identifiers or configurations.
